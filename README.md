# EGEN310RCcar
Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Project. This repo holds the Arduino code used for controlling the car with the Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect App.
This will also house the logic used for our Bluetooth enabled pump switch that used an Arduino UNO, HC-06 bluetooth module, and a 5v relay integrated with an outlet.
